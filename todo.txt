Cache info to reduce cpu overhead
optimize harvesting cycles with multiple sources, ecspecially creeps blocking each other after harvesting
optimize and automate Spawning of creeps (optionally some maths with predefined cpu expenditure to callculate optimal solutions later on)
Spawning creeps after the colonies needs, not after count (usage of spawnQue?)
defensive and offensive capabilitys by bots and structures
automated building of facilities
cpu management, caching to allow for long term susatainability
scouting patterns

obv. optimizing the code in respect on readability and maintainability
